[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/trevorforrey/SousChef.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/trevorforrey/SousChef)

### Running:
Because we utilize google apis and a mongo database with a password behind it, our keys are stored outside of git.
If you'd like to run the server yourself for grading purposes let us know and we can send that information with
instructions on how to set up all environment variables

### Demoing:
To interact with our site you can go to the following:
- [Web App](https://master-heroku-souchef.herokuapp.com/) - Add a user, add a recipe, view cookbook
- [Cooking Assistant (Google Assistant)](https://bot.dialogflow.com/201dfebf-ef6d-4c66-9b85-50e5e4bdc8fc) - Ask for ingredients, steps, cook time, etc.

On both you can login as the user _thetoastyone_ with the password of _toast_
On the google assistant side, you can choose to cook the recipe _Bread and Butter_ or _Grilled Cheese_
